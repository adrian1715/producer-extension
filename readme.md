## Installation

1. **Download the Extension Files**

   - Save all the provided files in a folder called `producer-extension`
   - You'll need: `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `background.js`, `content.js`, `rules.json`

2. **Load into Chrome**

   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select your `producer-extension` folder
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions bar

3. **Create Icon Files (Optional)**
   - Create an `icons` folder in your extension directory
   - Add icon files: `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
   - Or remove the icons section from manifest.json if you don't want custom icons

## How to Use

1. Click the **Producer** extension icon in your toolbar
2. Click **Start Producing** to begin a focus session
3. Add websites or URLs you want to block
4. Sites will be blocked until you stop the focus session

## Adding Block Rules

### Block Entire Domain

- Select **Block Domain**
- Enter a domain like `youtube.com` or `reddit.com`
- This blocks the entire website and all its pages

### Block Specific URLs

- Select **Block Specific URL**
- Enter specific paths like `youtube.com/feed/trending`
- This blocks only that page/section

### Allow Specific URLs

- Select **Allow Specific URL**
- Enter URLs you want to allow on otherwise blocked domains
- Example: Block `youtube.com` but allow `youtube.com/playlist?list=WL`

### **Allow Specific URL Parameters**

- Fine-tune allowed pages based on their query parameters
- Example:

  - Block `youtube.com/watch` (all videos)
  - **Allow only videos in a specific playlist:**

    ```
    URL: youtube.com/watch
    allowParams: ?list=PL123456789
    ```

  - Now all videos outside that playlist will be blocked, but the playlist is allowed

## Usage Examples

**Block all YouTube videos except from Watch Later playlist**

1. Add rule: **Block Specific URL** â†’ `youtube.com`
2. Add rule: **Allow Parameter** = key `list` value `WL`

**Block Instagram but allow direct inbox**

1. Add rule: **Block Domain** â†’ `instagram.com`
2. Add rule: **Allow Specific URL** â†’ `instagram.com/direct/inbox`

**Block X (Twitter) general feed but allow your communities**

1. Add rule: **Block Specific URL** â†’ `x.com`
2. Add rule: **Allow Specific URL** â†’ `x.com/{username}/communities`
